# Recipe Networks

This project analyzes different dishes in terms of their ingredients. Based on a number of mutual ingredients a graph representation of dishes is created. A cluster analysis shows the distinctiveness and similarity between different cuisines. 
In order to manage the computational load of the clustering algorithms, several clustering operations were performed on smaller samples of the data (Monte-Carlo Approximation).

Note: This project was created under considerable time pressure. I consider it some of my ugliest code -please take it with a grain of salt.
